This is for mining XKR with Termux on Android. 

It is recommended to get the latest version of termux <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Installing_from_F-Droid">here</a>.
 
```
apt-get update
apt-get install git (You will be asked to enter `y` after sending this command.)
pkg install cmake   (You will be asked to enter `y` after sending this command.)
```
Now on to cloning XMRig repo.

```
apt update 
apt upgrade  
git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git 
cd xmrig
```
It should look something like this now.

After running cmake you have to 'make' it. NOTE: This step might take a while depending on what phone you are on!
```
make
```

Enter `ls` and you will get a list of everything within the folder you're in.
